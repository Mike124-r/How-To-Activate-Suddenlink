This page will show you how to turn on your Suddenlink services, whether you're setting up internet, cable TV, or voice. It will also give you answers to common problems you could have when you try to activate your services.

What Suddenlink Activation Means
The activation process connects the service and equipment you bought to your account, making sure that everything is ready to use. If you don't finish activation, your internet might not operate, your TV service might not load channels, or your phone might not work right.

Activation also lets Suddenlink:

Make sure your device is registered correctly.

Apply your selected plan and features 

Test signal strength and troubleshoot remotely 

Connect your service to your billing and account settings.

Whether you’re moving into a new house or updating your plan, proper activation ensures everything operates well from day one. 

How to Turn on Suddenlink Internet Service
If you want to set up your Suddenlink internet yourself, follow these steps to get it going:

Step 1: Take your equipment out of the box
A modem, power adapter, Ethernet cable, and coaxial cable should all be in your installation kit. Make sure that all the equipment is there.

Step 2: Hook up the hardware
Connect the coaxial line from the wall outlet to your modem.

Connect the power adapter and wait for the modem to turn on.

If you need to, use the Ethernet wire to connect your modem to a router or computer.

Let the lights on the modem settle down. A solid power and online light usually means it's ready.

Step 3: Get your Internet going online
Open a browser on a device that is linked to the internet, like a phone or computer.

You should be routed to the Suddenlink activation page. 

If not, type the activation address into the browser by hand.

Use your account number or phone number to activate your service by following the instructions on the screen.

When you're done, your internet service should be up and running.

How to Turn on Suddenlink Cable TV
If you get cable TV as part of your service:

Step 1: Get the Receiver Ready
Plug the coaxial wire into the back of the cable box from the wall outlet.

Connect the box to your TV with an HDMI cable.

Connect the power adapter and turn on the TV.

Step 2: Connect the remote
Follow the instructions on the screen to connect your remote to the TV and cable box.

Step 3: Turn on the service
If asked, go to the Suddenlink activation website on a different device.

If you have an activation code, enter it here or your account information.

Give the box a few minutes to download updates and channels.

Once you're done, you should be able to watch all the stations and enjoy full TV service.

How to Turn on Your Suddenlink Phone Service
If you have Suddenlink's home phone service,

Connect the phone line from your phone to the "TEL 1" port on the back of the modem or gateway.

Wait for the TEL light on the modem to stay on.

If you hear a dial tone when you pick up the phone, the service is working.

If you don't hear a dial tone, try restarting the modem and then trying again.

If you want to transfer your number or port it from another operator, activation can take longer and need extra steps from customer support.

Common Problems with Suddenlink Activation and How to Fix Them
Even when everything is set up right, difficulties with activation can still happen. This is how to fix the problem:

The modem won't connect.
Check that all of the cords are firmly in place.

Try restarting the modem.

Make sure the coaxial plug in your home is working.

If you can, use a different coaxial outlet.

The activation page won't load.
Make sure you are connected to the modem using Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

Clear your cache or try a new browser.

Turn off your modem and device and then back on.

TV Not Showing Any Channels
Make sure all the HDMI and power cords are plugged in.

Make sure your TV is configured to the right input source.

Wait a few minutes for the channels and instructions to load.

Turn off and on your cable box.

Not able to use the phone service
Make sure the phone is plugged in correctly.

Wait for the TEL light to stop blinking.

If your number is still being transferred, call assistance.

If these methods don't fix the problem, you can get help from Suddenlink customer support with guided troubleshooting or arrange a technician to come to your home.

How to Make Activation Go Smoothly
Get your account number and service address handy.

Carefully read the directions in your installation kit.

For improved Wi-Fi coverage, put your modem in the middle of the room.

Use your own router for mesh networking or other sophisticated features.

If you have trouble setting things up, get in touch with assistance right away.
